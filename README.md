# CLR-for-Li-adsorption-on-regular-Janus-TMDs
This is a cluster-wise linear regression (CLR) machine learning model to predict the adsorption energies of Li on 2D materials. The dataset contains 75 examples of Li adsorption on top of regular and Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at 4 different concentrations.
