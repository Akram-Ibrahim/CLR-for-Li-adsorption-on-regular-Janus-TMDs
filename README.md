# CLR-for-Li-adsorption-on-regular-Janus-TMDs
This repository provides a cluster-wise linear regression (CLR) machine learning model to predict the adsorption energies of Li on 2D materials. The training set contains 75 examples of Li adsorption energies on top of regular and Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) at 4 different concentrations (coressponding to 4 different supercell sizes [1x1x1, 2x2x1, 3x3x1, and 4x4x1]). 

A MATLAB code which was used to calculate one of the descriptors is provided with a data.xlsx file to get the needed data from it. Other descriptors were obtained directly from DFT calculations. 

A Jupyter notebook which was used to apply the CLR model to the dataset is also provided.
